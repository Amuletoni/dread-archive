## Overview

Silent Hill 2 is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror games ever made and a masterclass in psychological horror storytelling. Unlike its predecessor, the game tells a standalone story focused on the deeply personal demons of its protagonist.

## Gameplay

The game features classic survival horror gameplay with fixed camera angles, limited combat resources, and puzzle-solving. Combat is intentionally clunky, emphasizing vulnerability over empowerment.

## Legacy

The game has inspired countless analyses of its symbolism, monster design, and multiple endings. Its influence can be seen in everything from indie horror games to mainstream titles like The Last of Us.
